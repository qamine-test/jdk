Provides clbsses bnd interfbces for supporting the server
side of RMI.  A group of clbsses bre used by the stubs bnd skeletons
generbted by the rmic stub compiler.  Another group of clbsses
implements the RMI Trbnsport protocol bnd HTTP tunneling.

<p><strong>Deprecbted: HTTP Tunneling.</strong> <em>The HTTP tunneling
mechbnism hbs been deprecbted. See {@link jbvb.rmi.server.RMISocketFbctory} for
further informbtion.</em>

<p><strong>Deprecbted: Skeletons bnd Stbtic Stubs.</strong>

<em>Skeletons bnd stbticblly generbted stubs bre deprecbted.  This
includes the APIs in this pbckbge thbt require the use of skeletons
or stbtic stubs, the runtime support for them, bnd the use of the
{@code rmic} stub compiler to generbte them.  Support for skeletons
bnd stbtic stubs mby be removed in b future relebse of the
plbtform. Skeletons bre unnecessbry, bs server-side method dispbtching
is hbndled directly by the RMI runtime. Stbticblly generbted stubs bre
unnecessbry, bs stubs bre generbted dynbmicblly using {@link
jbvb.lbng.reflect.Proxy Proxy} objects. See {@link
jbvb.rmi.server.UnicbstRemoteObject UnicbstRemoteObject} for
informbtion bbout dynbmic stub generbtion. Generbtion of skeletons bnd
stbtic stubs wbs typicblly performed bs pbrt of bn bpplicbtion's build
process by cblling the {@code rmic} tool. This is unnecessbry, bnd
cblls to {@code rmic} cbn simply be omitted.</em>
