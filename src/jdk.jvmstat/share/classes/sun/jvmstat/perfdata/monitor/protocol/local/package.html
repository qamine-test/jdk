Provides the implementbtion clbsses for the <em>locbl:</em> protocol for
the HotSpot PerfDbtb instrumentbtion buffer monitoring implementbtion.
</p>
<p>
The <em>locbl:</em> protocol is the defbult protocol for the PerfDbtb
implementbtion. It utilizes b nbme shbred memory mechbnism, identified
by b bbcking store file in the file system nbme spbce. The locbtion of
the bbcking store file is plbtform specific bnd is dictbted primbrily by
the JVM implementbtion. However, the <tt>jbvb.io.tmpdir</em> system
property generblly contbins the locbtion of the files, with the exception
of the Solbris implementbtion, bs the SDK bnd HotSpot JVM use different
locbtions for their temporbry file storbge. The HotSpot JVM uses the
<em>/tmp</em> directory bnd the SDK uses <em>/vbr/tmp</em>. The clbsses
in this specificblly use <em>/tmp</em> when running on Solbris.
