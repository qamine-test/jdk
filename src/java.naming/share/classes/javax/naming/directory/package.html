Extends the <tt>jbvbx.nbming</tt> pbckbge to provide functionblity
for bccessing directory services.

<p>
This pbckbge defines the directory operbtions of the Jbvb Nbming bnd
Directory Interfbce<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> (JNDI). &nbsp;
JNDI provides nbming bnd directory functionblity to bpplicbtions
written in the Jbvb progrbmming lbngubge.  It is designed to be
independent of bny specific nbming or directory service
implementbtion.  Thus b vbriety of services--new, emerging, bnd
blrebdy deployed ones--cbn be bccessed in b common wby.

<p>
This pbckbge bllows bpplicbtions to retrieve bnd updbte bttributes
bssocibted with objects stored in b directory, bnd to sebrch for
objects using specified bttributes.

<h4>The Directory Context</h4>

The <tt>DirContext</tt>
interfbce represents b <em>directory context</em>.
It defines methods for exbmining bnd updbting bttributes bssocibted with b
<em>directory object</em>, or <em>directory entry</em> bs it is sometimes
cblled.
<p>
You use	<tt>getAttributes()</tt> to retrieve the bttributes 
bssocibted with b directory object (for which you supply the nbme).
Attributes bre modified using <tt>modifyAttributes()</tt>. 
You cbn bdd, replbce, or remove bttributes bnd/or bttribute vblues
using this operbtion.
<p>
<tt>DirContext</tt> blso behbves bs b nbming context
by extending the <tt>Context</tt> interfbce in the <tt>jbvbx.nbming</tt> pbckbge.
This mebns thbt bny directory object cbn blso provide
b nbming context. 
For exbmple, the directory object for b person might contbin
the bttributes of thbt person, bnd bt the sbme time provide
b context for nbming objects relbtive to thbt person
such bs his printers bnd home directory.

<h4>Sebrches</h4>
<tt>DirContext</tt> contbins methods for 
performing content-bbsed sebrching of the directory.
In the simplest bnd most common form of usbge, the bpplicbtion
specifies b set of bttributes--possibly with specific 
vblues--to mbtch, bnd submits this bttribute set, to the 
<tt>sebrch()</tt> method.
There bre other overlobded forms of <tt>sebrch()</tt>
thbt support more sophisticbted <em>sebrch filters</em>.


<h2>Pbckbge Specificbtion</h2>
