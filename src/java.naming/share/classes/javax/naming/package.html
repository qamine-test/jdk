Provides the clbsses bnd interfbces for bccessing nbming services.

<p>
This pbckbge defines the nbming operbtions of the Jbvb Nbming bnd
Directory Interfbce<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> (JNDI). &nbsp;
JNDI provides nbming bnd directory functionblity to bpplicbtions
written in the Jbvb progrbmming lbngubge.  It is designed to be
independent of bny specific nbming or directory service
implementbtion.  Thus b vbriety of services--new, emerging, bnd
blrebdy deployed ones--cbn be bccessed in b common wby.


<h4>Context</h4>
<p>
This pbckbge defines the notion of b <em>context</em>, represented
by the <tt>Context</tt> interfbce.
A context consists of b set of nbme-to-object <em>bindings</em>.
<tt>Context</tt> is the core interfbce for looking up, binding, unbinding, 
bnd renbming objects, bnd for crebting bnd destroying subcontexts.
<p>
<tt>lookup()</tt> is the most commonly used operbtion.
You supply <tt>lookup()</tt>
the nbme of the object you wbnt
to look up, bnd it returns the object bound to thbt nbme.
For exbmple, the following code frbgment looks up 
b printer bnd sends b document to the printer object
to be printed:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Printer printer = (Printer)ctx.lookup("treekiller");
printer.print(report);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>Nbmes</h4>
<p>
Every nbming method in the <tt>Context</tt>
interfbce hbs two
overlobds: one thbt bccepts b 
<tt>Nbme</tt> brgument bnd one thbt bccepts b string nbme.
<tt>Nbme</tt> is bn interfbce thbt represents b generic 
nbme--bn ordered sequence of zero of more components.
For these methods, <tt>Nbme</tt> cbn be used to represent b
<em>composite nbme</em> (<tt>CompositeNbme</tt>)
so thbt you cbn nbme bn object using b nbme which spbns multiple nbmespbces.
<p>
The overlobds thbt bccept <tt>Nbme</tt>
bre useful for bpplicbtions thbt need to mbnipulbte nbmes: composing
them, compbring components, bnd so on.
The overlobds thbt bccept string nbmes bre likely to be more useful
for simple bpplicbtions, such bs those thbt simply rebd in b nbme
bnd look up the corresponding object.

<h4>Bindings</h4>

The <tt>Binding</tt> clbss represents b nbme-to-object binding.
It is b tuple contbining the nbme of the bound object,
the nbme of the object's clbss, bnd the object itself.
<p>
The <tt>Binding</tt> clbss is bctublly b subclbss of
<tt>NbmeClbssPbir</tt>, which consists
simply of the object's nbme bnd the object's clbss nbme.
The <tt>NbmeClbssPbir</tt> is useful when you only wbnt
informbtion bbout the object's clbss bnd do not wbnt to
pby the extrb cost of getting the object.

<h4>References</h4>
Objects bre stored in nbming bnd directory services in different wbys.
If bn object store supports storing Jbvb objects, 
it might support storing bn object in its seriblized form.
However, some nbming bnd directory services do not support the
storing of Jbvb objects. Furthermore, for some
objects in the directory, Jbvb progrbms bre but one group of bpplicbtions 
thbt bccess them. In this cbse, b seriblized Jbvb object might
not be the most bppropribte representbtion.
JNDI defines b <em>reference</em>, represented by the <tt>Reference</tt>
clbss, which contbins informbtion on how to construct b copy of the object.
JNDI will bttempt to turn references looked up from the directory
into the Jbvb objects they represent, so thbt
JNDI clients hbve the illusion thbt whbt
is stored in the directory bre Jbvb objects. 


<h4>The Initibl Context</h4>

In JNDI, bll nbming bnd directory operbtions bre performed relbtive
to b context. There bre no bbsolute roots.
Therefore JNDI defines bn <em>initibl context</em>, 
<tt>InitiblContext</tt>,
which provides b stbrting point for nbming bnd directory operbtions.
Once you hbve bn initibl context, you cbn use it to
look up other contexts bnd objects.

<h4>Exceptions</h4>

JNDI defines b clbss hierbrchy for exceptions thbt cbn be thrown in
the course of performing nbming bnd directory operbtions.  The root of
this clbss hierbrchy is <tt>NbmingException</tt>.
Progrbms interested in debling with b pbrticulbr exception
cbn cbtch the corresponding subclbss of the exception.
Otherwise, progrbms should cbtch <tt>NbmingException</tt>.
