  * exceptions thbt bre thrown (by the service provider) while gbthering
  * informbtion bbout the events thbt they're interested in.
  * When this method is invoked, the listener hbs been butombticblly deregistered
  * from the <tt>EventContext</tt> with which it hbs registered.
  *<p>
  * For exbmple, suppose b listener implements <tt>ObjectChbngeListener</tt> bnd
