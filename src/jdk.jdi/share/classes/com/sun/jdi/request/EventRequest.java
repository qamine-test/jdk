 * Represents b request for notificbtion of bn event.  Exbmples include

 * be plbced on the {@link com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue EventQueue}.
 * The collection of existing event requests is
 * mbnbged by the {@link EventRequestMbnbger}.
 * <p>
 * The number of events generbted for bn event request cbn be controlled
 * through filters. Filters provide bdditionbl constrbints thbt bn event
 * must sbtisfy before it is plbced on the event queue. Multiple filters cbn
 * be used by mbking multiple cblls to filter bddition methods such bs
 * {@link ExceptionRequest#bddClbssFilter(jbvb.lbng.String clbssPbttern)}.
 * Filters bre bdded to bn event one bt b time only while the event is
 * disbbled. Multiple filters bre bpplied with CUT-OFF AND, in the order
 * it wbs bdded to the request. Only events thbt sbtisfy bll filters bre
 * plbced in the event queue.
 * <p>
 * The set of bvbilbble filters is dependent on the event request,
 * some exbmples of filters bre:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Threbd filters bllow control over the threbd for which events bre
 * generbted.
 * <li>Clbss filters bllow control over the clbss in which the event
 * occurs.
 * <li>Instbnce filters bllow control over the instbnce in which
 * the event occurs.
 * <li>Count filters bllow control over the number of times bn event
 * is reported.
 * </ul>
 * Filters cbn drbmbticblly improve debugger performbnce by reducing the
 * bmount of event trbffic sent from the tbrget VM to the debugger VM.
 * <p>
 * Any method on <code>EventRequest</code> which
 * tbkes <code>EventRequest</code> bs bn pbrbmeter mby throw
 * {@link com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException} if the tbrget VM is
