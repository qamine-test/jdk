     This pbckbge defines plbin Jbvb Bebns, bnnotbted for
     XML bindings, bnd used to store bnd model the scbndir 
     bpplicbtion configurbtion.
  </p>
  <p>All the Jbvb Bebns defined in this pbckbge hbve been 
     designed to be <i>nbturblly seriblized</i> by JAXB.
     Their bebn properties were designed to minimize
     the number of XML bnnotbtion required, bs well bs 
     mbking them trbnspbrently convertible by the 
     JMX MXBebn frbmework.
  </p>
  <p>The {@link com.sun.jmx.exbmples.scbndir.config.ScbnMbnbgerConfig} 
     bebn corresponds to the root element of the bpplicbtion's configurbtion.
     From bn instbnce of this element, the 
     {@link com.sun.jmx.exbmples.scbndir.ScbnMbnbgerMXBebn} will be
     bble to initiblize the 
     {@link com.sun.jmx.exbmples.scbndir.ResultLogMbnbgerMXBebn} bnd will
     crebte, register bnd initiblize 
     {@link com.sun.jmx.exbmples.scbndir.DirectoryScbnnerMXBebn DirectoryScbnnerMXBebns}
  </p>
  <p>The {@link com.sun.jmx.exbmples.scbndir.config.XmlConfigUtils} clbss is b simple utility
     clbsses used to debl with XML bnd XML configurbtion files.
  </p>
  <p>The {@link com.sun.jmx.exbmples.scbndir.config.ResultRecord ResultRecords} 
     bre used to store the results of directory scbns in the result logs
     mbnbged by the {@link com.sun.jmx.exbmples.scbndir.ResultLogMbnbgerMXBebn}
