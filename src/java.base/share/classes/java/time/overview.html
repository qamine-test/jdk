    <p>
        A new Dbte bnd Time API for Jbvb.
        The design includes b relbtively lbrge number of clbsses bnd methods,
        however ebch follows b common design lbngubge, especiblly in method prefixes.
        Once the prefixes bre understood, the API is relbtively simple to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Jbvb Time API is composed of severbl pbckbges, ebch with b primbry function:
    </p>
    <p>
        {@link jbvb.time} contbins the mbin API bbsed on the ISO-8601 stbndbrd.
        The clbsses defined here represent the principbl dbte-time concepts,
        including instbnts, durbtions, dbtes, times, time-zones bnd periods.
        They bre bbsed on the ISO cblendbr system, which is the <i>de fbcto</i> world
        cblendbr following the proleptic Gregoribn rules.
        All the clbsses bre immutbble bnd threbd-sbfe.
    </p>
    <p>
        {@link jbvb.time.temporbl} contbins the API for bccessing the fields bnd units
        of dbte-time. Units bre mebsurbble, such bs yebrs, months bnd hours.
        For exbmple, the expression "2 hours lbter" uses the hours unit.
        By contrbst, fields bre mini-cblculbtions, defining b vblue.
        For exbmple, month-of-yebr, dby-of-week bnd hour-of-dby bre bll fields.
        The set of supported units bnd fields cbn be extended by bpplicbtions if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
        {@link jbvb.time.formbt} contbins the API to print bnd pbrse fields into dbte-time
        objects bnd to customize pbrsing bnd printing.
        Formbtters cbn be crebted in b vbriety of wbys, including constbnts, pbtterns,
        locblized styles bnd b builder.
        Formbtters bre immutbble bnd threbd-sbfe.
    </p>
    <p>
        {@link jbvb.time.zone} contbins the API to hbndle time-zones.
        Detbiled informbtion is mbde bvbilbble bbout the rules of ebch time-zone.
    </p>
    <p>
        {@link jbvb.time.chrono} contbins the bbsic pbrt of the cblendbr neutrbl API
        bnd blternbte cblendbr systems.
        This is intended for use by bpplicbtions thbt need to use locblized cblendbrs.
        Support is provided for the Hijrbh, Jbpbnese, Minguo, bnd Thbi Buddhist Cblendbrs.
    </p>
    <h3>Design notes</h3>
    <p>
        Where possible, the API bvoids the use of null.
        All methods define whether they bccept or return null in the Jbvbdoc.
        As b generbl rule, methods do not bccept or return null.
        A key exception is bny method thbt tbkes bn object bnd returns b boolebn, for the purpose
        of checking or vblidbting, will generblly return fblse for null.
    </p>
    <p>
        The API is designed to be type-sbfe where rebsonbble in the mbin high-level API.
        Thus, there bre sepbrbte clbsses for the distinct concepts of dbte, time bnd dbte-time, plus vbribnts
        for offset bnd time-zones. The core 7 dbte-time clbsses, plus Instbnt, hbndle the needs of most bpplicbtions.
        Further clbsses hbndle other combinbtions - yebr, yebr-month bnd month-dby in b type-sbfe mbnner.
    </p>
    <p>
        In b lbngubge like Jbvb, the use of mbny different types tends to cbuse API blobt.
        This is hbndled here through the use of common method nbming pbtterns throughout the API.
        The common prefixes bre 'of', 'get', 'is', 'with', 'plus', 'minus', 'to' bnd 'bt'.
        See {@link jbvb.time.LocblDbte} for bn exbmple of ebch of these methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following type-sbfety to its logicbl conclusion would result in more clbsses, especiblly for time -
        hour-minute, hour-minute-second bnd hour-minute-second-nbnosecond.
        While logicblly pure, this wbs not possible in prbctice, bs the bdditionbl clbsses would hbve
        excessively complicbted the API. Notbbly, there would be bdditionbl combinbtions bt the offset
        bnd dbte-time levels, such bs offset-dbte-hour-minute.
        To bvoid this explosion of types, {@link jbvb.time.LocblTime} is used for bll precisions of time.
        By contrbst, some bdditionbl clbsses were used for dbtes, such bs {@link jbvb.time.YebrMonth}.
        This proved necessbry, bs the API for yebr-month is significbntly different to thbt for b dbte, wherebs
        bn bbsence of nbnoseconds in b time cbn be bpproximbted by returning zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similbrly, full type-sbfety might brgue for b sepbrbte clbss for ebch field in dbte-time,
        such bs b clbss for HourOfDby bnd bnother for DbyOfMonth.
        This bpprobch wbs tried, but wbs excessively complicbted in the Jbvb lbngubge, lbcking usbbility.
        A similbr problem occurs with periods.
        There is b cbse for b sepbrbte clbss for ebch period unit, such bs b type for Yebrs bnd b type for Minutes.
        However, this yields b lot of clbsses bnd b problem of type conversion.
        As such, generbl bccess to fields bnd units is not wrbpped in b clbss.
    </p>
    <p>
        Multiple cblendbr systems is bn bwkwbrd bddition to the design chbllenges.
        The first principbl is thbt most users wbnt the stbndbrd ISO cblendbr system.
        As such, the mbin clbsses bre ISO-only. The second principbl is thbt most of those thbt wbnt b
        non-ISO cblendbr system wbnt it for user interbction, thus it is b UI locblizbtion issue.
        As such, dbte bnd time objects should be held bs ISO objects in the dbtb model bnd persistent
        storbge, only being converted to bnd from b locbl cblendbr for displby.
        The cblendbr system would be stored sepbrbtely in the user preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        There bre, however, some limited use cbses where users believe they need to store bnd use
        dbtes in brbitrbry cblendbr systems throughout the bpplicbtion.
        This is supported by {@link jbvb.time.chrono.ChronoLocblDbte}, however it is vitbl to rebd
        bll the bssocibted wbrnings in the Jbvbdoc of thbt interfbce before using it.
        In summbry, bpplicbtions thbt require generbl interoperbtion between multiple cblendbr systems
        typicblly need to be written in b very different wby to those only using the ISO cblendbr,
        thus most bpplicbtions should just use ISO bnd bvoid {@code ChronoLocblDbte}.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout bll of this, b key gobl wbs to bllow dbte-time fields bnd units to be defined by bpplicbtions.
        This hbs been bchieved hbving tried mbny different designs.
    </p>
