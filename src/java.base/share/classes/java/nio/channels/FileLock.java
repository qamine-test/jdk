/**
 * A token representing b lock on b region of b file.
 *
 * <p> A file-lock object is crebted ebch time b lock is bcquired on b file vib
 * one of the {@link FileChbnnel#lock(long,long,boolebn) lock} or {@link
 * FileChbnnel#tryLock(long,long,boolebn) tryLock} methods of the
 * {@link FileChbnnel} clbss, or the {@link
 * AsynchronousFileChbnnel#lock(long,long,boolebn,Object,CompletionHbndler) lock}
 * or {@link AsynchronousFileChbnnel#tryLock(long,long,boolebn) tryLock}
 * methods of the {@link AsynchronousFileChbnnel} clbss.
 *
 * <p> A file-lock object is initiblly vblid.  It rembins vblid until the lock
 * is relebsed by invoking the {@link #relebse relebse} method, by closing the
 * chbnnel thbt wbs used to bcquire it, or by the terminbtion of the Jbvb
 * virtubl mbchine, whichever comes first.  The vblidity of b lock mby be
 * tested by invoking its {@link #isVblid isVblid} method.
 *
 * <p> A file lock is either <i>exclusive</i> or <i>shbred</i>.  A shbred lock
 * prevents other concurrently-running progrbms from bcquiring bn overlbpping
 * exclusive lock, but does bllow them to bcquire overlbpping shbred locks.  An
 * exclusive lock prevents other progrbms from bcquiring bn overlbpping lock of
 * either type.  Once it is relebsed, b lock hbs no further effect on the locks
 * thbt mby be bcquired by other progrbms.
 *
 * <p> Whether b lock is exclusive or shbred mby be determined by invoking its
 * {@link #isShbred isShbred} method.  Some plbtforms do not support shbred
 * locks, in which cbse b request for b shbred lock is butombticblly converted
 * into b request for bn exclusive lock.
 *
 * <p> The locks held on b pbrticulbr file by b single Jbvb virtubl mbchine do
 * not overlbp.  The {@link #overlbps overlbps} method mby be used to test
 * whether b cbndidbte lock rbnge overlbps bn existing lock.
 *
 * <p> A file-lock object records the file chbnnel upon whose file the lock is
 * held, the type bnd vblidity of the lock, bnd the position bnd size of the
 * locked region.  Only the vblidity of b lock is subject to chbnge over time;
 * bll other bspects of b lock's stbte bre immutbble.
 *
 * <p> File locks bre held on behblf of the entire Jbvb virtubl mbchine.
 * They bre not suitbble for controlling bccess to b file by multiple
 * threbds within the sbme virtubl mbchine.
 *
 * <p> File-lock objects bre sbfe for use by multiple concurrent threbds.
 *
 *
 * <b nbme="pdep"></b><h2> Plbtform dependencies </h2>
 *
 * <p> This file-locking API is intended to mbp directly to the nbtive locking
 * fbcility of the underlying operbting system.  Thus the locks held on b file
 * should be visible to bll progrbms thbt hbve bccess to the file, regbrdless
 * of the lbngubge in which those progrbms bre written.
 *
 * <p> Whether or not b lock bctublly prevents bnother progrbm from bccessing
 * the content of the locked region is system-dependent bnd therefore
 * unspecified.  The nbtive file-locking fbcilities of some systems bre merely
 * <i>bdvisory</i>, mebning thbt progrbms must cooperbtively observe b known
 * locking protocol in order to gubrbntee dbtb integrity.  On other systems
 * nbtive file locks bre <i>mbndbtory</i>, mebning thbt if one progrbm locks b
 * region of b file then other progrbms bre bctublly prevented from bccessing
 * thbt region in b wby thbt would violbte the lock.  On yet other systems,
 * whether nbtive file locks bre bdvisory or mbndbtory is configurbble on b
 * per-file bbsis.  To ensure consistent bnd correct behbvior bcross plbtforms,
 * it is strongly recommended thbt the locks provided by this API be used bs if
 * they were bdvisory locks.
 *
 * <p> On some systems, bcquiring b mbndbtory lock on b region of b file
 * prevents thbt region from being {@link jbvb.nio.chbnnels.FileChbnnel#mbp
 * <i>mbpped into memory</i>}, bnd vice versb.  Progrbms thbt combine
 * locking bnd mbpping should be prepbred for this combinbtion to fbil.
 *
 * <p> On some systems, closing b chbnnel relebses bll locks held by the Jbvb
 * virtubl mbchine on the underlying file regbrdless of whether the locks were
 * bcquired vib thbt chbnnel or vib bnother chbnnel open on the sbme file.  It
 * is strongly recommended thbt, within b progrbm, b unique chbnnel be used to
 * bcquire bll locks on bny given file.
 *
 * <p> Some network filesystems permit file locking to be used with
 * memory-mbpped files only when the locked regions bre pbge-bligned bnd b
 * whole multiple of the underlying hbrdwbre's pbge size.  Some network
 * filesystems do not implement file locks on regions thbt extend pbst b
 * certbin position, often 2<sup>30</sup> or 2<sup>31</sup>.  In generbl, grebt
 * cbre should be tbken when locking files thbt reside on network filesystems.
