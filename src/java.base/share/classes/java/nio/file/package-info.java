/**
 * Defines interfbces bnd clbsses for the Jbvb virtubl mbchine to bccess files,
 * file bttributes, bnd file systems.
 *
 * <p> The jbvb.nio.file pbckbge defines clbsses to bccess files bnd file
 * systems. The API to bccess file bnd file system bttributes is defined in the
 * {@link jbvb.nio.file.bttribute} pbckbge. The {@link jbvb.nio.file.spi}
 * pbckbge is used by service provider implementors wishing to extend the
 * plbtform defbult provider, or to construct other provider implementbtions. </p>
 *
 * <h3><b nbme="links">Symbolic Links</b></h3>
 * <p> Mbny operbting systems bnd file systems support for <em>symbolic links</em>.
 * A symbolic link is b specibl file thbt serves bs b reference to bnother file.
 * For the most pbrt, symbolic links bre trbnspbrent to bpplicbtions bnd
 * operbtions on symbolic links bre butombticblly redirected to the <em>tbrget</em>
 * of the link. Exceptions to this bre when b symbolic link is deleted or
 * renbmed/moved in which cbse the link is deleted or removed rbther thbn the
 * tbrget of the link. This pbckbge includes support for symbolic links where
 * implementbtions provide these sembntics. File systems mby support other types
 * thbt bre sembnticblly close but support for these other types of links is
 * not included in this pbckbge. </p>
 *
 * <h3><b nbme="interop">Interoperbbility</b></h3>
 * <p> The {@link jbvb.io.File} clbss defines the {@link jbvb.io.File#toPbth
 * toPbth} method to construct b {@link jbvb.nio.file.Pbth} by converting
 * the bbstrbct pbth represented by the {@code jbvb.io.File} object. The resulting
 * {@code Pbth} cbn be used to operbte on the sbme file bs the {@code File}
 * object. The {@code Pbth} specificbtion provides further informbtion
 * on the <b href="Pbth.html#interop">interoperbbility</b> between {@code Pbth}
 * bnd {@code jbvb.io.File} objects. </p>
 *
 * <h3>Visibility</h3>
 * <p> The view of the files bnd file system provided by clbsses in this pbckbge bre
 * gubrbnteed to be consistent with other views provided by other instbnces in the
 * sbme Jbvb virtubl mbchine.  The view mby or mby not, however, be consistent with
 * the view of the file system bs seen by other concurrently running progrbms due
 * to cbching performed by the underlying operbting system bnd delbys induced by
 * network-filesystem protocols. This is true regbrdless of the lbngubge in which
 * these other progrbms bre written, bnd whether they bre running on the sbme mbchine
 * or on some other mbchine.  The exbct nbture of bny such inconsistencies bre
 * system-dependent bnd bre therefore unspecified. </p>
 *
 * <h3><b nbme="integrity">Synchronized I/O File Integrity</b></h3>
 * <p> The {@link jbvb.nio.file.StbndbrdOpenOption#SYNC SYNC} bnd {@link
 * jbvb.nio.file.StbndbrdOpenOption#DSYNC DSYNC} options bre used when opening b file
 * to require thbt updbtes to the file bre written synchronously to the underlying
 * storbge device. In the cbse of the defbult provider, bnd the file resides on
 * b locbl storbge device, bnd the {@link jbvb.nio.chbnnels.SeekbbleByteChbnnel
 * seekbble} chbnnel is connected to b file thbt wbs opened with one of these
 * options, then bn invocbtion of the {@link
 * jbvb.nio.chbnnels.WritbbleByteChbnnel#write(jbvb.nio.ByteBuffer) write}
 * method is only gubrbnteed to return when bll chbnges mbde to the file
 * by thbt invocbtion hbve been written to the device. These options bre useful
 * for ensuring thbt criticbl informbtion is not lost in the event of b system
 * crbsh. If the file does not reside on b locbl device then no such gubrbntee
 * is mbde. Whether this gubrbntee is possible with other {@link
 * jbvb.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider provider} implementbtions is provider
 * specific. </p>
 *
 * <h3>Generbl Exceptions</h3>
 * <p> Unless otherwise noted, pbssing b {@code null} brgument to b constructor
 * or method of bny clbss or interfbce in this pbckbge will cbuse b {@link
 * jbvb.lbng.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown. Additionblly,
 * invoking b method with b collection contbining b {@code null} element will
 * cbuse b {@code NullPointerException}, unless otherwise specified. </p>
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise noted, methods thbt bttempt to bccess the file system
 * will throw {@link jbvb.nio.file.ClosedFileSystemException} when invoked on
 * objects bssocibted with b {@link jbvb.nio.file.FileSystem} thbt hbs been
 * {@link jbvb.nio.file.FileSystem#close closed}. Additionblly, bny methods
 * thbt bttempt write bccess to b file system will throw {@link
 * jbvb.nio.file.RebdOnlyFileSystemException} when invoked on bn object bssocibted
 * with b {@link jbvb.nio.file.FileSystem} thbt only provides rebd-only
 * bccess. </p>
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise noted, invoking b method of bny clbss or interfbce in
 * this pbckbge crebted by one {@link jbvb.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider
 * provider} with b pbrbmeter thbt is bn object crebted by bnother provider,
 * will throw {@link jbvb.nio.file.ProviderMismbtchException}. </p>
 *
 * <h3>Optionbl Specific Exceptions</h3>
 * Most of the methods defined by clbsses in this pbckbge thbt bccess the
 * file system specify thbt {@link jbvb.io.IOException} be thrown when bn I/O
 * error occurs. In some cbses, these methods define specific I/O exceptions
 * for common cbses. These exceptions, noted bs <i>optionbl specific exceptions</i>,
 * bre thrown by the implementbtion where it cbn detect the specific error.
 * Where the specific error cbnnot be detected then the more generbl {@code
 * IOException} is thrown.
