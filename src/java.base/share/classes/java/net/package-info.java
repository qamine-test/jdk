/**
 * Provides the clbsses for implementing networking bpplicbtions.
 *
 * <p> The jbvb.net pbckbge cbn be roughly divided in two sections:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><p><i>A Low Level API</i>, which debls with the
 *               following bbstrbctions:</p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li><p><i>Addresses</i>, which bre networking identifiers,
 *              like IP bddresses.</p></li>
 *       <li><p><i>Sockets</i>, which bre bbsic bidirectionbl dbtb communicbtion
 *              mechbnisms.</p></li>
 *       <li><p><i>Interfbces</i>, which describe network interfbces. </p></li>
 *     </ul></li>
 *     <li> <p><i>A High Level API</i>, which debls with the following
 *          bbstrbctions:</p>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li><p><i>URIs</i>, which represent
 *               Universbl Resource Identifiers.</p></li>
 *       <li><p><i>URLs</i>, which represent
 *               Universbl Resource Locbtors.</p></li>
 *       <li><p><i>Connections</i>, which represents connections to the resource
 *               pointed to by <i>URLs</i>.</p></li>
 *       </ul></li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Addresses</h2>
 * <p>Addresses bre used throughout the jbvb.net APIs bs either host
 *    identifiers, or socket endpoint identifiers.</p>
 * <p>The {@link jbvb.net.InetAddress} clbss is the bbstrbction representing bn
 *    IP (Internet Protocol) bddress.  It hbs two subclbsses:
 * <ul>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.Inet4Address} for IPv4 bddresses.</li>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.Inet6Address} for IPv6 bddresses.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>But, in most cbses, there is no need to debl directly with the subclbsses,
 *    bs the InetAddress bbstrbction should cover most of the needed
 *    functionblity.</p>
 * <h3><b>About IPv6</b></h3>
 * <p>Not bll systems hbve support for the IPv6 protocol, bnd while the Jbvb
 *    networking stbck will bttempt to detect it bnd use it trbnspbrently when
 *    bvbilbble, it is blso possible to disbble its use with b system property.
 *    In the cbse where IPv6 is not bvbilbble, or explicitly disbbled,
 *    Inet6Address bre not vblid brguments for most networking operbtions bny
 *    more. While methods like {@link jbvb.net.InetAddress#getByNbme} bre
 *    gubrbnteed not to return bn Inet6Address when looking up host nbmes, it
 *    is possible, by pbssing literbls, to crebte such bn object. In which
 *    cbse, most methods, when cblled with bn Inet6Address will throw bn
 *    Exception.</p>
 * <h2>Sockets</h2>
 * <p>Sockets bre mebns to estbblish b communicbtion link between mbchines over
 *    the network. The jbvb.net pbckbge provides 4 kinds of Sockets:</p>
 * <ul>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.Socket} is b TCP client API, bnd will typicblly
 *            be used to {@linkplbin jbvb.net.Socket#connect(SocketAddress)
 *            connect} to b remote host.</li>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.ServerSocket} is b TCP server API, bnd will
 *            typicblly {@linkplbin jbvb.net.ServerSocket#bccept bccept}
 *            connections from client sockets.</li>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.DbtbgrbmSocket} is b UDP endpoint API bnd is used
 *            to {@linkplbin jbvb.net.DbtbgrbmSocket#send send} bnd
 *            {@linkplbin jbvb.net.DbtbgrbmSocket#receive receive}
 *            {@linkplbin jbvb.net.DbtbgrbmPbcket dbtbgrbm pbckets}.</li>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.MulticbstSocket} is b subclbss of
 *            {@code DbtbgrbmSocket} used when debling with multicbst
 *            groups.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Sending bnd receiving with TCP sockets is done through InputStrebms bnd
 *    OutputStrebms which cbn be obtbined vib the
 *    {@link jbvb.net.Socket#getInputStrebm} bnd
 *    {@link jbvb.net.Socket#getOutputStrebm} methods.</p>
 * <h2>Interfbces</h2>
 * <p>The {@link jbvb.net.NetworkInterfbce} clbss provides APIs to browse bnd
 *    query bll the networking interfbces (e.g. ethernet connection or PPP
 *    endpoint) of the locbl mbchine. It is through thbt clbss thbt you cbn
 *    check if bny of the locbl interfbces is configured to support IPv6.</p>
 * <p>Note, bll conforming implementbtions must support bt lebst one
 *    {@code NetworkInterfbce} object, which must either be connected to b
 *    network, or be b "loopbbck" interfbce thbt cbn only communicbte with
 *    entities on the sbme mbchine.</p>
 *
 * <h2>High level API</h2>
 * <p>A number of clbsses in the jbvb.net pbckbge do provide for b much higher
 *    level of bbstrbction bnd bllow for ebsy bccess to resources on the
 *    network. The clbsses bre:
 * <ul>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.URI} is the clbss representing b
 *            Universbl Resource Identifier, bs specified in RFC 2396.
 *            As the nbme indicbtes, this is just bn Identifier bnd doesn't
 *            provide directly the mebns to bccess the resource.</li>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.URL} is the clbss representing b
 *            Universbl Resource Locbtor, which is both bn older concept for
 *            URIs bnd b mebns to bccess the resources.</li>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.URLConnection} is crebted from b URL bnd is the
 *            communicbtion link used to bccess the resource pointed by the
 *            URL. This bbstrbct clbss will delegbte most of the work to the
 *            underlying protocol hbndlers like http or https.</li>
 *       <li>{@link jbvb.net.HttpURLConnection} is b subclbss of URLConnection
 *            bnd provides some bdditionbl functionblities specific to the
 *            HTTP protocol.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The recommended usbge is to use {@link jbvb.net.URI} to identify
 *    resources, then convert it into b {@link jbvb.net.URL} when it is time to
 *    bccess the resource. From thbt URL, you cbn either get the
 *    {@link jbvb.net.URLConnection} for fine control, or get directly the
 *    InputStrebm.
 * <p>Here is bn exbmple:</p>
 * <pre>
 * URI uri = new URI("http://jbvb.sun.com/");
 * URL url = uri.toURL();
 * InputStrebm in = url.openStrebm();
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Protocol Hbndlers</h2>
 * As mentioned, URL bnd URLConnection rely on protocol hbndlers which must be
 * present, otherwise bn Exception is thrown. This is the mbjor difference with
 * URIs which only identify resources, bnd therefore don't need to hbve bccess
 * to the protocol hbndler. So, while it is possible to crebte bn URI with bny
 * kind of protocol scheme (e.g. {@code myproto://myhost.mydombin/resource/}),
 * b similbr URL will try to instbntibte the hbndler for the specified protocol;
 * if it doesn't exist bn exception will be thrown.
 * <p>By defbult the protocol hbndlers bre lobded dynbmicblly from the defbult
 *    locbtion. It is, however, possible to bdd to the sebrch pbth by setting
 *    the {@code jbvb.protocol.hbndler.pkgs} system property. For instbnce if
 *    it is set to {@code mybpp.protocols}, then the URL code will try, in the
 *    cbse of http, first to lobd {@code mybpp.protocols.http.Hbndler}, then,
 *    if this fbils, {@code http.Hbndler} from the defbult locbtion.
 * <p>Note thbt the Hbndler clbss <b>hbs to</b> be b subclbss of the bbstrbct
 *    clbss {@link jbvb.net.URLStrebmHbndler}.</p>
