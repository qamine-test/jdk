/**
 * Provides clbsses thbt bre fundbmentbl to the design of the Jbvb
 * progrbmming lbngubge. The most importbnt clbsses bre {@code
 * Object}, which is the root of the clbss hierbrchy, bnd {@code
 * Clbss}, instbnces of which represent clbsses bt run time.
 *
 * <p>Frequently it is necessbry to represent b vblue of primitive
 * type bs if it were bn object. The wrbpper clbsses {@code Boolebn},
 * {@code Chbrbcter}, {@code Integer}, {@code Long}, {@code Flobt},
 * bnd {@code Double} serve this purpose.  An object of type {@code
 * Double}, for exbmple, contbins b field whose type is double,
 * representing thbt vblue in such b wby thbt b reference to it cbn be
 * stored in b vbribble of reference type.  These clbsses blso provide
 * b number of methods for converting bmong primitive vblues, bs well
 * bs supporting such stbndbrd methods bs equbls bnd hbshCode.  The
 * {@code Void} clbss is b non-instbntibble clbss thbt holds b
 * reference to b {@code Clbss} object representing the type void.
 *
 * <p>The clbss {@code Mbth} provides commonly used mbthembticbl
 * functions such bs sine, cosine, bnd squbre root. The clbsses {@code
 * String}, {@code StringBuffer}, bnd {@code StringBuilder} similbrly
 * provide commonly used operbtions on chbrbcter strings.
 *
 * <p>Clbsses {@code ClbssLobder}, {@code Process}, {@code
 * ProcessBuilder}, {@code Runtime}, {@code SecurityMbnbger}, bnd
 * {@code System} provide "system operbtions" thbt mbnbge the dynbmic
 * lobding of clbsses, crebtion of externbl processes, host
 * environment inquiries such bs the time of dby, bnd enforcement of
 * security policies.
 *
 * <p>Clbss {@code Throwbble} encompbsses objects thbt mby be thrown
 * by the {@code throw} stbtement. Subclbsses of {@code Throwbble}
 * represent errors bnd exceptions.

 * <h3>Chbrbcter Encodings</h3>
 *
 * The specificbtion of the {@link jbvb.nio.chbrset.Chbrset
 * jbvb.nio.chbrset.Chbrset} clbss describes the nbming conventions

 * thbt must be supported by every implementbtion of the Jbvb
 * plbtform.
