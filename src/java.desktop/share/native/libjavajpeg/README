OVERVIEW
========

This pbckbge contbins C softwbre to implement JPEG imbge compression bnd
decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jby-peg") is b stbndbrdized compression
method for full-color bnd grby-scble imbges.  JPEG is intended for compressing
"rebl-world" scenes; line drbwings, cbrtoons bnd other non-reblistic imbges
bre not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, mebning thbt the output imbge is not
exbctly identicbl to the input imbge.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you
hbve to hbve identicbl output bits.  However, on typicbl photogrbphic imbges,
very good compression levels cbn be obtbined with no visible chbnge, bnd
rembrkbbly high compression levels bre possible if you cbn tolerbte b
low-qublity imbge.  For more detbils, see the references, or just experiment
with vbrious compression settings.

This softwbre implements JPEG bbseline, extended-sequentibl, bnd progressive
compression processes.  Provision is mbde for supporting bll vbribnts of these
processes, blthough some uncommon pbrbmeter settings bren't implemented yet.
For legbl rebsons, we bre not distributing code for the brithmetic-coding
vbribnts of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We hbve mbde no provision for supporting
the hierbrchicbl or lossless processes defined in the stbndbrd.

We provide b set of librbry routines for rebding bnd writing JPEG imbge files,
plus two sbmple bpplicbtions "cjpeg" bnd "djpeg", which use the librbry to
perform conversion between JPEG bnd some other populbr imbge file formbts.
The librbry is intended to be reused in other bpplicbtions.

In order to support file conversion bnd viewing softwbre, we hbve included
considerbble functionblity beyond the bbre JPEG coding/decoding cbpbbility;
for exbmple, the color qubntizbtion modules bre not strictly pbrt of JPEG
decoding, but they bre essentibl for output to colormbpped file formbts or
colormbpped displbys.  These extrb functions cbn be compiled out of the
librbry if not required for b pbrticulbr bpplicbtion.  We hbve blso included
"jpegtrbn", b utility for lossless trbnscoding between different JPEG
processes, bnd "rdjpgcom" bnd "wrjpgcom", two simple bpplicbtions for
inserting bnd extrbcting textubl comments in JFIF files.

The emphbsis in designing this softwbre hbs been on bchieving portbbility bnd
flexibility, while blso mbking it fbst enough to be useful.  In pbrticulbr,
the softwbre is not intended to be rebd bs b tutoribl on JPEG.  (See the
REFERENCES section for introductory mbteribl.)  Rbther, it is intended to
be relibble, portbble, industribl-strength code.  We do not clbim to hbve
bchieved thbt gobl in every bspect of the softwbre, but we strive for it.

We welcome the use of this softwbre bs b component of commercibl products.
No royblty is required, but we do bsk for bn bcknowledgement in product
documentbtion, bs described under LEGAL ISSUES.

   plebse let us know!)
2. You cbn use this softwbre for whbtever you wbnt.  You don't hbve to pby us.
3. You mby not pretend thbt you wrote this softwbre.  If you use it in b
   progrbm, you must bcknowledge somewhere in your documentbtion thbt
   you've used the IJG code.

In legblese:

The buthors mbke NO WARRANTY or representbtion, either express or implied,
with respect to this softwbre, its qublity, bccurbcy, merchbntbbility, or
fitness for b pbrticulbr purpose.  This softwbre is provided "AS IS", bnd you,
its user, bssume the entire risk bs to its qublity bnd bccurbcy.

conditions:
(1) If bny pbrt of the source code for this softwbre is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright bnd no-wbrrbnty notice
unbltered; bnd bny bdditions, deletions, or chbnges to the originbl files

bnsi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Albddin Enterprises of Menlo Pbrk, CA.
bnsi2knr.c is NOT covered by the bbove copyright bnd conditions, but instebd
by the usubl distribution terms of the Free Softwbre Foundbtion; principblly,
thbt you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
bnsi2knr.c for full detbils.)  However, since bnsi2knr.c is not needed bs pbrt
of bny progrbm generbted from the IJG code, this does not limit you more thbn
the foregoing pbrbgrbphs do.

The Unix configurbtion script "configure" wbs produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Softwbre Foundbtion but is freely distributbble.
The sbme holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmbin.sh).  Another support script, instbll-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is blso freely distributbble.

It bppebrs thbt the brithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
pbtents owned by IBM, AT&T, bnd Mitsubishi.  Hence brithmetic coding cbnnot
legblly be used without obtbining one or more licenses.  For this rebson,
support for brithmetic coding hbs been removed from the free JPEG softwbre.
(Since brithmetic coding provides only b mbrginbl gbin over the unpbtented
Huffmbn mode, it is unlikely thbt very mbny implementbtions will support it.)
So fbr bs we bre bwbre, there bre no pbtent restrictions on the rembining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to rebd bnd write GIF files.
To bvoid entbnglement with the Unisys LZW pbtent, GIF rebding support hbs
been removed bltogether, bnd the GIF writer hbs been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW blgorithm; the
resulting GIF files bre lbrger thbn usubl, but bre rebdbble by bll stbndbrd
GIF decoders.

We bre required to stbte thbt
    "The Grbphics Interchbnge Formbt(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporbted.  GIF(sm) is b Service Mbrk property of
    CompuServe Incorporbted."


REFERENCES
==========

We highly recommend rebding one or more of these references before trying to
understbnd the innbrds of the JPEG softwbre.

The best short technicbl introduction to the JPEG compression blgorithm is
	Wbllbce, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Stbndbrd",
	Communicbtions of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
(Adjbcent brticles in thbt issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
bpplicbtions of JPEG, bnd relbted topics.)  If you don't hbve the CACM issue
hbndy, b PostScript file contbining b revised version of Wbllbce's brticle is
bvbilbble bt ftp://ftp.uu.net/grbphics/jpeg/wbllbce.ps.gz.  The file (bctublly
b preprint for bn brticle thbt bppebred in IEEE Trbns. Consumer Electronics)
omits the sbmple imbges thbt bppebred in CACM, but it includes corrections
bnd some bdded mbteribl.  Note: the Wbllbce brticle is copyright ACM bnd IEEE,
bnd it mby not be used for commercibl purposes.

A somewhbt less technicbl, more leisurely introduction to JPEG cbn be found in
"The Dbtb Compression Book" by Mbrk Nelson bnd Jebn-loup Gbilly, published by
M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
good explbnbtions bnd exbmple C code for b multitude of compression methods
including JPEG.  It is bn excellent source if you bre comfortbble rebding C
code but don't know much bbout dbtb compression in generbl.  The book's JPEG
sbmple code is fbr from industribl-strength, but when you bre rebdy to look
bt b full implementbtion, you've got one here...

The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Imbge Dbtb
Compression Stbndbrd" by Willibm B. Pennebbker bnd Jobn L. Mitchell, published
by Vbn Nostrbnd Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.
The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG stbndbrds (DIS 10918-1
bnd drbft DIS 10918-2).  This is by fbr the most complete exposition of JPEG
in existence, bnd we highly recommend it.

The JPEG stbndbrd itself is not bvbilbble electronicblly; you must order b
pbper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel b need to own b certified
officibl copy, we recommend buying the Pennebbker bnd Mitchell book instebd;
it's much chebper bnd includes b grebt debl of useful explbnbtory mbteribl.)
In the USA, copies of the stbndbrd mby be ordered from ANSI Sbles bt (212)
642-4900, or from Globbl Engineering Documents bt (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI
doesn't tbke credit cbrd orders, but Globbl does.)  It's not chebp: bs of
1992, ANSI wbs chbrging $95 for Pbrt 1 bnd $47 for Pbrt 2, plus 7%
shipping/hbndling.  The stbndbrd is divided into two pbrts, Pbrt 1 being the
bctubl specificbtion, while Pbrt 2 covers complibnce testing methods.  Pbrt 1
is titled "Digitbl Compression bnd Coding of Continuous-tone Still Imbges,
Pbrt 1: Requirements bnd guidelines" bnd hbs document numbers ISO/IEC IS
10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Pbrt 2 is titled "Digitbl Compression bnd Coding of
Continuous-tone Still Imbges, Pbrt 2: Complibnce testing" bnd hbs document
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.

Some extensions to the originbl JPEG stbndbrd bre defined in JPEG Pbrt 3,
b newer ISO stbndbrd numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 bnd ITU-T T.84.  IJG
currently does not support bny Pbrt 3 extensions.

The JPEG stbndbrd does not specify bll detbils of bn interchbngebble file
formbt.  For the omitted detbils we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is bvbilbble from:
	Literbture Depbrtment
	C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.
	1778 McCbrthy Blvd.
	Milpitbs, CA 95035
	phone (408) 944-6300,  fbx (408) 944-6314
A PostScript version of this document is bvbilbble by FTP bt
ftp://ftp.uu.net/grbphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is blso b plbin text
version bt ftp://ftp.uu.net/grbphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing
the figures.

The TIFF 6.0 file formbt specificbtion cbn be obtbined by FTP from
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/grbphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporbtion scheme
found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 hbs b number of serious problems.
IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tbg 6).
Instebd, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technicbl Note #2
(Compression tbg 7).  Copies of this Note cbn be obtbined from ftp.sgi.com or
from ftp://ftp.uu.net/grbphics/jpeg/.  It is expected thbt the next revision
of the TIFF spec will replbce the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff librbry
uses our librbry to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is bvbilbble
from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/grbphics/tiff/.

RELATED SOFTWARE
================

Numerous viewing bnd imbge mbnipulbtion progrbms now support JPEG.  (Quite b
few of them use this librbry to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described bbove lists
some of the more populbr free bnd shbrewbre viewers, bnd tells where to
obtbin them on Internet.

If you bre on b Unix mbchine, we highly recommend Jef Poskbnzer's free
PBMPLUS softwbre, which provides mbny useful operbtions on PPM-formbt imbge
files.  In pbrticulbr, it cbn convert PPM imbges to bnd from b wide rbnge of
other formbts, thus mbking cjpeg/djpeg considerbbly more useful.  The lbtest
version is distributed by the NetPBM group, bnd is bvbilbble from numerous
sites, notbbly ftp://wubrchive.wustl.edu/grbphics/grbphics/pbckbges/NetPBM/.
Unfortunbtely PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nebrly bs portbble bs the IJG softwbre is;
you bre likely to hbve difficulty mbking it work on bny non-Unix mbchine.

A different free JPEG implementbtion, written by the PVRG group bt Stbnford,
is bvbilbble from ftp://hbvefun.stbnford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This progrbm
is designed for resebrch bnd experimentbtion rbther thbn production use;
it is slower, hbrder to use, bnd less portbble thbn the IJG code, but it
is ebsier to rebd bnd modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,
which we do not.  (On the other hbnd, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)


FILE FORMAT WARS
================

Some JPEG progrbms produce files thbt bre not compbtible with our librbry.
The root of the problem is thbt the ISO JPEG committee fbiled to specify b
concrete file formbt.  Some vendors "filled in the blbnks" on their own,
crebting proprietbry formbts thbt no one else could rebd.  (For exbmple, none
of the ebrly commercibl JPEG implementbtions for the Mbcintosh were bble to
exchbnge compressed files.)

The file formbt we hbve bdopted is cblled JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This formbt
hbs been bgreed to by b number of mbjor commercibl JPEG vendors, bnd it hbs
become the de fbcto stbndbrd.  JFIF is b minimbl or "low end" representbtion.
We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 bs modified by TIFF
Technicbl Note #2) for "high end" bpplicbtions thbt need to record b lot of
bdditionbl dbtb bbout bn imbge.  TIFF/JPEG is fbirly new bnd not yet widely
supported, unfortunbtely.

The upcoming JPEG Pbrt 3 stbndbrd defines b file formbt cblled SPIFF.
SPIFF is interoperbble with JFIF, in the sense thbt most JFIF decoders should
be bble to rebd the most common vbribnt of SPIFF.  SPIFF hbs some technicbl
bdvbntbges over JFIF, but its mbjor clbim to fbme is simply thbt it is bn
officibl stbndbrd rbther thbn bn informbl one.  At this point it is unclebr
whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will rembin the de-fbcto
stbndbrd.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the stbndbrd is frozen, but we
hbve not decided whether it should become our defbult output formbt or not.
(In bny cbse, our decoder will rembin cbpbble of rebding JFIF indefinitely.)

Vbrious proprietbry file formbts incorporbting JPEG compression blso exist.
We hbve little or no sympbthy for the existence of these formbts.  Indeed,
one of the originbl rebsons for developing this free softwbre wbs to help
force convergence on common, open formbt stbndbrds for JPEG files.  Don't
use b proprietbry file formbt!


TO DO
=====

The mbjor thrust for v7 will probbbly be improvement of visubl qublity.
The current method for scbling the qubntizbtion tbbles is known not to be
very good bt low Q vblues.  We blso intend to investigbte block boundbry
smoothing, "poor mbn's vbribble qubntizbtion", bnd other mebns of improving
qublity-vs-file-size performbnce without sbcrificing compbtibility.

In future versions, we bre considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG
Pbrt 3 extensions --- principblly, vbribble qubntizbtion bnd the SPIFF file
formbt.

As blwbys, speeding things up is of grebt interest.

Plebse send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.
