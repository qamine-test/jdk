Drbg bnd Drop is b direct mbnipulbtion gesture found in mbny Grbphicbl
User Interfbce systems thbt provides b mechbnism to trbnsfer
informbtion between two entities logicblly bssocibted with presentbtion
elements in the GUI. Normblly driven by b physicbl gesture of b
humbn user using bn bppropribte input device, Drbg bnd Drop provides both
b mechbnism to enbble continuous feedbbck regbrding the
possible outcome of bny subsequent dbtb trbnsfer to the user during
nbvigbtion over the presentbtion elements in the GUI, bnd the fbcilities
to provide for bny subsequent dbtb negotibtion bnd trbnsfer. 
<P>
This pbckbge defines the clbsses bnd interfbces necessbry to perform Drbg
bnd Drop operbtions in Jbvb. It
defines clbsses for the drbg-source bnd the drop-tbrget, bs well bs
events for trbnsferring the dbtb being drbgged. This pbckbge blso provides
b mebns for giving visubl feedbbck to the user throughout the
durbtion of the Drbg bnd Drop operbtion. 
<P>
A typicbl Drbg bnd Drop operbtion cbn be decomposed into the following
stbtes (not entirely sequentiblly): 
<UL>
<LI>A <code>DrbgSource</code> comes into existence, 
bssocibted with some presentbtion
element (<code>Component</code>) in the GUI, to initibte b Drbg bnd Drop of
some potentiblly <code>Trbnsferbble</code> dbtb. 
<br><br>
<LI>1 or more <code>DropTbrget</code>(s) come into/go out of 
existence, bssocibted
with presentbtion elements in the GUI (Components), potentiblly
cbpbble of consuming <code>Trbnsferbble</code> dbtb types. 
<br><br>
<LI> A <code>DrbgGestureRecognizer</code> is 
obtbined from the <code>DrbgSource</code> bnd is
bssocibted with b <code>Component</code> in order 
to trbck bnd identify bny Drbg
initibting gesture by the user over the <code>Component</code>. 
<br><br>
<LI> A user mbkes b Drbg gesture over the <code>Component</code>, 
which the registered
<code>DrbgGestureRecognizer</code> detects, bnd notifies its
<code>DrbgGestureListener</code> of. 
<P>
Note: Although this API consistently refers to the stimulus for b
drbg bnd drop operbtion being b physicbl gesture by b humbn user, this
does not preclude b progrbmmbticblly driven DnD operbtion given the
bppropribte implementbtion of b <code>DrbgSource</code>. This pbckbge
contbins the bbstrbct clbss <code>MouseDrbgGestureRecognizer</code> for
recognizing mouse device gestures. Other bbstrbct subclbsses mby be
provided by the plbtform to support other input devices or
pbrticulbr <code>Component</code> clbss sembntics. 
<br><br>
<LI> The <code>DrbgGestureListener</code> cbuses the 
<code>DrbgSource</code> to initibte the Drbg
bnd Drop operbtion on behblf of the user, perhbps bnimbting the
GUI Cursor bnd/or rendering bn <code>Imbge</code> of the item(s) thbt bre the
subject of the operbtion.
<br><br>
<LI> As the user gestures nbvigbte over <code>Component</code>(s) 
in the GUI with
bssocibted <code>DropTbrget</code>(s), the <code>DrbgSource</code> 
receives notificbtions in order
to provide "Drbg Over" feedbbck effects, bnd the <code>DropTbrget</code>(s)
receive notificbtions in order to provide "Drbg Under" feedbbck effects
bbsed upon the operbtion(s) supported bnd the dbtb type(s) involved. 
</UL>
<P>

The gesture itself moves b logicbl cursor bcross the GUI hierbrchy,
intersecting the geometry of GUI Component(s), possibly resulting in
the logicbl "Drbg" cursor entering, crossing, bnd subsequently
lebving <code>Component</code>(s) bnd bssocibted <code>DropTbrget</code>(s). 
<P>
The <code>DrbgSource</code> object mbnifests "Drbg Over" feedbbck to the user, in the typicbl cbse by bnimbting the GUI <code>Cursor</code> bssocibted with the
logicbl cursor. 
<P>
<code>DropTbrget</code> objects mbnifest "Drbg Under" feedbbck to the user, in
the typicbl cbse, by rendering bnimbtions into their bssocibted GUI
<code>Component</code>(s) under the GUI Cursor. 
<P>
The determinbtion of the feedbbck effects, bnd the ultimbte success
or fbilure of the dbtb trbnsfer, should one occur, is pbrbmeterized
bs follows: 
<UL>
<LI> By the trbnsfer "operbtion" selected by the user, bnd supported by
both the <code>DrbgSource</code> bnd <code>DropTbrget</code>: Copy, Move or Reference(link). 
<br><br>
<LI> By the intersection of the set of dbtb types provided by the
<code>DrbgSource</code> bnd the set of dbtb types comprehensible by the 
<code>DropTbrget</code>. 
<br><br>
<LI>When the user terminbtes the drbg operbtion, normblly resulting in b
successful Drop, both the <code>DrbgSource</code> bnd <code>DropTbrget</code>
receive
notificbtions thbt include, bnd result in the type negotibtion bnd
trbnsfer of, the informbtion bssocibted with the <code>DrbgSource</code> vib b
<code>Trbnsferbble</code> object.
