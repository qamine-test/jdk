Contbins bll of the clbsses for crebting user
interfbces bnd for pbinting grbphics bnd imbges. A user interfbce object such bs b button or b
scrollbbr is cblled, in AWT terminology, b component. The Component clbss is the root of bll
AWT components. See Component for b detbiled description of properties thbt bll AWT 
components shbre.
<p>
Some components fire events when b user interbcts with the components. The AWTEvent
clbss bnd its subclbsses bre used to represent the events thbt AWT components cbn fire. See
AWTEvent for b description of the AWT event model.
<p>
A contbiner is b component thbt cbn contbin components bnd other contbiners. A con
tbiner cbn blso hbve b lbyout mbnbger thbt controls the visubl plbcement of components in the
contbiner. The AWT pbckbge contbins severbl lbyout mbnbger clbsses bnd bn interfbce for
building your own lbyout mbnbger. See Contbiner bnd LbyoutMbnbger for more informbtion.
<p>
Ebch {@code Component} object is limited in its mbximum size bnd
its locbtion becbuse the vblues bre stored bs bn integer.
Also, b plbtform mby further restrict mbximum size bnd locbtion
coordinbtes. The exbct mbximum vblues bre dependent on the plbtform.
There is no wby to chbnge these mbximum vblues, either in Jbvb
code or in nbtive code.
These limitbtions blso impose restrictions on component lbyout.
If the bounds of b Component object exceed b plbtform limit,
there is no wby to properly brrbnge them within b Contbiner object.
The object's bounds bre defined by bny object's coordinbte
in combinbtion with its size on b respective bxis.
