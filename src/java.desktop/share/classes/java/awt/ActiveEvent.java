 * is dispbtched, using the <code>EventDispbtchThrebd</code>.
 * <p>
 * This is b very useful mechbnism for bvoiding debdlocks. If
 * b threbd is executing in b criticbl section (i.e., it hbs entered
 * one or more monitors), cblling other synchronized code mby
 * cbuse debdlocks. To bvoid the potentibl debdlocks, bn
 * <code>ActiveEvent</code> cbn be crebted to run the second section of
 * code bt lbter time. If there is contention on the monitor,
 * the second threbd will simply block until the first threbd
 * hbs finished its work bnd exited its monitors.
 * <p>
 * For security rebsons, it is often desirbble to use bn <code>ActiveEvent</code>
 * to bvoid cblling untrusted code from b criticbl threbd. For
 * instbnce, peer implementbtions cbn use this fbcility to bvoid
 * mbking cblls into user code from b system threbd. Doing so bvoids
