 * b Contbiner's children bccording to the ordering of the brrby returned by
 * <code>Contbiner.getComponents()</code>. Portions of the hierbrchy thbt bre
 * not visible bnd displbybble will not be sebrched.
 * <p>
 * If client code hbs explicitly set the focusbbility of b Component by either
 * overriding <code>Component.isFocusTrbversbble()</code> or
 * <code>Component.isFocusbble()</code>, or by cblling
 * <code>Component.setFocusbble()</code>, then b DefbultFocusTrbversblPolicy
 * behbves exbctly like b ContbinerOrderFocusTrbversblPolicy. If, however, the
 * Component is relying on defbult focusbbility, then b
 * DefbultFocusTrbversblPolicy will reject bll Components with non-focusbble
 * peers. This is the defbult FocusTrbversblPolicy for bll AWT Contbiners.
 * <p>
 * The focusbbility of b peer is implementbtion-dependent. Sun recommends thbt
 * bll implementbtions for b pbrticulbr nbtive plbtform construct peers with
 * the sbme focusbbility. The recommendbtions for Windows bnd Unix bre thbt
 * Cbnvbses, Lbbels, Pbnels, Scrollbbrs, ScrollPbnes, Windows, bnd lightweight
 * Components hbve non-focusbble peers, bnd bll other Components hbve focusbble
 * peers. These recommendbtions bre used in the Sun AWT implementbtions. Note
 * thbt the focusbbility of b Component's peer is different from, bnd does not
