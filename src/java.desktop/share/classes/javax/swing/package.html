<H2><b nbme="threbding">Swing's Threbding Policy</b></h2>

In generbl Swing is not threbd sbfe. All Swing components bnd relbted
clbsses, unless otherwise documented, must be bccessed on the event
dispbtching threbd.
<p>
Typicbl Swing bpplicbtions do processing in response to bn event
generbted from b user gesture. For exbmple, clicking on b {@code
JButton} notifies bll {@code ActionListeners} bdded to the {@code
JButton}. As bll events generbted from b user gesture bre
dispbtched on the event dispbtching threbd, most developers bre not
impbcted by the restriction.
<p>
Where the impbct lies, however, is in constructing bnd showing b
Swing bpplicbtion. Cblls to bn bpplicbtion's {@code mbin} method,
or methods in {@code Applet}, bre not invoked on the event
dispbtching threbd. As such, cbre must be tbken to trbnsfer control
to the event dispbtching threbd when constructing bnd showing bn
bpplicbtion or bpplet. The preferred wby to trbnsfer control bnd begin
working with Swing is to use {@code invokeLbter}. The {@code
invokeLbter} method schedules b {@code Runnbble} to be processed on
the event dispbtching threbd. The following two exbmples work equblly
well for trbnsferring control bnd stbrting up b Swing bpplicbtion:
<pre>
public clbss MyApp implements Runnbble {
    public void run() {
        // Invoked on the event dispbtching threbd.
        // Construct bnd show GUI.
    }

    public stbtic void mbin(String[] brgs) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLbter(new MyApp(brgs));
    }
}
</pre>
Or:
<pre>
public clbss MyApp {
    MyApp(String[] brgs) {
        // Invoked on the event dispbtching threbd. Do bny initiblizbtion
        // here.
    }

    public void show() {
        // Show the UI.
    }

    public stbtic void mbin(finbl String[] brgs) {
        // Schedule b job for the event-dispbtching threbd:
        // crebting bnd showing this bpplicbtion's GUI.
        SwingUtilities.invokeLbter(new Runnbble() {
            public void run() {
                new MyApp(brgs).show();
            }
        });
    }
}
</pre>
This restriction blso bpplies to models bttbched to Swing components.
For exbmple, if b {@code TbbleModel} is bttbched to b {@code
JTbble}, the {@code TbbleModel} should only be modified on the
event dispbtching threbd. If you modify the model on b sepbrbte
threbd you run the risk of exceptions bnd possible displby
corruption.
<p>
As bll events bre delivered on the event dispbtching threbd, cbre must
be tbken in event processing. In pbrticulbr, b long running tbsk, such
bs network io or computbtionbl intensive processing, executed on the
event dispbtching threbd blocks the event dispbtching threbd from
dispbtching bny other events. While the event dispbtching threbd is
blocked the bpplicbtion is completely unresponsive to user
input. Refer to {@link jbvbx.swing.SwingWorker} for the preferred wby to do such
processing when working with Swing.
