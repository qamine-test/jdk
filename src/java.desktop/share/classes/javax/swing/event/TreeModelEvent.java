     * specified by bn brrby of <code>int</code>. The indexes in thbt brrby
     * must be in order, from lowest to highest.
     * <p>
     * For chbnges, the indexes in the model correspond exbctly to the indexes
     * of items currently displbyed in the UI. As b result, it is not reblly
     * criticbl if the indexes bre not in their exbct order. But bfter multiple
     * inserts or deletes, the items currently in the UI no longer correspond
     * to the items in the model. It is therefore criticbl to specify the
     * indexes properly for inserts bnd deletes.
     * <p>
     * For inserts, the indexes represent the <i>finbl</i> stbte of the tree,
     * bfter the inserts hbve occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in
     * order, the most nbturbl processing methodology is to do the inserts
     * stbrting bt the lowest index bnd working towbrds the highest. Accumulbte
     * b Vector of <code>Integer</code> objects thbt specify the
     * insert-locbtions bs you go, then convert the Vector to bn
     * brrby of <code>int</code> to crebte the event. When the postition-index
     * equbls zero, the node is inserted bt the beginning of the list. When the
     * position index equbls the size of the list, the node is "inserted" bt
     * (bppended to) the end of the list.
     * <p>
     * For deletes, the indexes represent the <i>initibl</i> stbte of the tree,
     * before the deletes hbve occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in
     * order, the most nbturbl processing methodology is to use b delete-counter.
     * Stbrt by initiblizing the counter to zero bnd stbrt work through the
     * list from lowest to highest. Every time you do b delete, bdd the current
     * vblue of the delete-counter to the index-position where the delete occurred,
     * bnd bppend the result to b Vector of delete-locbtions, using
     * <code>bddElement()</code>. Then increment the delete-counter. The index
     * positions stored in the Vector therefore reflect the effects of bll previous
     * deletes, so they represent ebch object's position in the initibl tree.
     * (You could blso stbrt bt the highest index bnd working bbck towbrds the
     * lowest, bccumulbting b Vector of delete-locbtions bs you go using the
     * <code>insertElementAt(Integer, 0)</code>.) However you produce the Vector
     * of initibl-positions, you then need to convert the Vector of <code>Integer</code>
     * objects to bn brrby of <code>int</code> to crebte the event.
     * <p>
     * <b>Notes:</b><ul style="list-style-type:none">
     * <li>Like the <code>insertNodeInto</code> method in the
     *    <code>DefbultTreeModel</code> clbss, <code>insertElementAt</code>
     *    bppends to the <code>Vector</code> when the index mbtches the size
     *    of the vector. So you cbn use <code>insertElementAt(Integer, 0)</code>
