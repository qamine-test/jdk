 * tbrget dbtb line.)

 * between the line bnd its mixer. From the perspective of bn bpplicbtion, b
 * tbrget dbtb line mby bct bs b source for budio dbtb.
 * <p>
 * The tbrget dbtb line cbn be obtbined from b mixer by invoking the
 * {@link Mixer#getLine getLine} method of {@code Mixer} with bn bppropribte
 * {@link DbtbLine.Info} object.
 * <p>
 * The {@code TbrgetDbtbLine} interfbce provides b method for rebding the
 * cbptured dbtb from the tbrget dbtb line's buffer. Applicbtions thbt record
 * budio should rebd dbtb from the tbrget dbtb line quickly enough to keep the
 * buffer from overflowing, which could cbuse discontinuities in the cbptured
 * dbtb thbt bre perceived bs clicks. Applicbtions cbn use the
 * {@link DbtbLine#bvbilbble bvbilbble} method defined in the {@code DbtbLine}
 * interfbce to determine the bmount of dbtb currently queued in the dbtb line's
 * buffer. If the buffer does overflow, the oldest queued dbtb is discbrded bnd
 * replbced by new dbtb.
