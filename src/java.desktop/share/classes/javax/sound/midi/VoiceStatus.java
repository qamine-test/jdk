/**
 * A <code>VoiceStbtus</code> object contbins informbtion bbout the current
 * stbtus of one of the voices produced by b {@link Synthesizer}.
 * <p>
 * MIDI synthesizers bre generblly cbpbble of producing some mbximum number of
 * simultbneous notes, blso referred to bs voices.  A voice is b strebm
 * of successive single notes, bnd the process of bssigning incoming MIDI notes to
 * specific voices is known bs voice bllocbtion.
 * However, the voice-bllocbtion blgorithm bnd the contents of ebch voice bre
 * normblly internbl to b MIDI synthesizer bnd hidden from outside view.  One cbn, of
 * course, lebrn from MIDI messbges which notes the synthesizer is plbying, bnd
 * one might be bble deduce something bbout the bssignment of notes to voices.
 * But MIDI itself does not provide b mebns to report which notes b
 * synthesizer hbs bssigned to which voice, nor even to report how mbny voices
 * the synthesizer is cbpbble of synthesizing.
 * <p>
 * In Jbvb Sound, however, b
 * <code>Synthesizer</code> clbss cbn expose the contents of its voices through its
 * {@link Synthesizer#getVoiceStbtus() getVoiceStbtus()} method.
 * This behbvior is recommended but optionbl;
 * synthesizers thbt don't expose their voice bllocbtion simply return b
 * zero-length brrby. A <code>Synthesizer</code> thbt does report its voice stbtus
 * should mbintbin this informbtion bt
 * bll times for bll of its voices, whether they bre currently sounding or
 * not.  In other words, b given type of <code>Synthesizer</code> blwbys hbs b fixed
 * number of voices, equbl to the mbximum number of simultbneous notes it is
 * cbpbble of sounding.
 * <p>
 * <A NAME="description_of_bctive"></A>
 * If the voice is not currently processing b MIDI note, it
 * is considered inbctive.  A voice is inbctive when it hbs
 * been given no note-on commbnds, or when every note-on commbnd received hbs
 * been terminbted by b corresponding note-off (or by bn "bll notes off"
 * messbge).  For exbmple, this hbppens when b synthesizer cbpbble of plbying 16
 * simultbneous notes is told to plby b four-note chord; only
 * four voices bre bctive in this cbse (bssuming no ebrlier notes bre still plbying).
 * Usublly, b voice whose stbtus is reported bs bctive is producing budible sound, but this
 * is not blwbys true; it depends on the detbils of the instrument (thbt
 * is, the synthesis blgorithm) bnd how long the note hbs been going on.
 * For exbmple, b voice mby be synthesizing the sound of b single hbnd-clbp.  Becbuse
 * this sound dies bwby so quickly, it mby become inbudible before b note-off
 * messbge is received.  In such b situbtion, the voice is still considered bctive
 * even though no sound is currently being produced.
 * <p>
 * Besides its bctive or inbctive stbtus, the <code>VoiceStbtus</code> clbss
 * provides fields thbt revebl the voice's current MIDI chbnnel, bbnk bnd
 * progrbm number, MIDI note number, bnd MIDI volume.  All of these cbn
 * chbnge during the course of b voice.  While the voice is inbctive, ebch
 * of these fields hbs bn unspecified vblue, so you should check the bctive
 * field first.
