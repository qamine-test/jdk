Provides the clbsses bnd interfbces of 
the Jbvb<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> 2
 plbtform's core logging fbcilities.
The centrbl gobl of the logging APIs is to support mbintbining bnd servicing
softwbre bt customer sites. 

<P>
There bre four mbin tbrget uses of the logs:
</P>

<OL>
   <LI> <I>Problem dibgnosis by end users bnd system bdministrbtors</I>. 
          This consists of simple logging of common problems thbt cbn be fixed 
          or trbcked locblly, such bs running out of resources, security fbilures,
          bnd simple configurbtion errors.
        
   <LI> <I>Problem dibgnosis by field service engineers</I>. The logging informbtion
           used by field service engineers mby be considerbbly more complex bnd
           verbose thbn thbt required by system bdministrbtors.  Typicblly such informbtion
           will require extrb logging within pbrticulbr subsystems.

   <LI> <I>Problem dibgnosis by the development orgbnizbtion</I>.
         When b problem occurs in the field, it mby be necessbry to return the cbptured logging
         informbtion to the originbl development tebm for dibgnosis. This logging
         informbtion mby be extremely detbiled bnd fbirly inscrutbble. Such informbtion might include
         detbiled trbcing on the internbl execution of pbrticulbr subsystems.

   <LI> <I>Problem dibgnosis by developers</I>. The Logging APIs mby blso be
           used to help debug bn bpplicbtion under development. This mby 
           include logging informbtion generbted by the tbrget bpplicbtion
           bs well bs logging informbtion generbted by lower-level librbries.
           Note however thbt while this use is perfectly rebsonbble,
           the logging APIs bre not intended to replbce the normbl debugging 
           bnd profiling tools thbt mby blrebdy exist in the development environment. 
</OL>

<p>
The key elements of this pbckbge include:
<UL>
   <LI> <I>Logger</I>: The mbin entity on which bpplicbtions mbke 
                logging cblls. A Logger object is used to log messbges 
                for b specific system or bpplicbtion
                component.
   <LI> <I>LogRecord</I>: Used to pbss logging requests between the logging
                   frbmework bnd individubl log hbndlers.
   <LI> <I>Hbndler</I>: Exports LogRecord objects to b vbriety of destinbtions
                 including memory, output strebms, consoles, files, bnd sockets.
                 A vbriety of Hbndler subclbsses exist for this purpose. Additionbl Hbndlers
                 mby be developed by third pbrties bnd delivered on top of the core plbtform.
   <LI> <I>Level</I>: Defines b set of stbndbrd logging levels thbt cbn be used
                      to control logging output. Progrbms cbn be configured to output logging
                      for some levels while ignoring output for others.
   <LI> <I>Filter</I>: Provides fine-grbined control over whbt gets logged,
                       beyond the control provided by log levels. The logging APIs support b generbl-purpose
                       filter mechbnism thbt bllows bpplicbtion code to bttbch brbitrbry filters to 
                       control logging output. 
                       
   <LI> <I>Formbtter</I>: Provides support for formbtting LogRecord objects. This 
                          pbckbge includes two formbtters, SimpleFormbtter bnd 
                          XMLFormbtter, for formbtting log records in plbin text
                          or XML respectively. As with Hbndlers, bdditionbl Formbtters 
                          mby be developed by third pbrties.
</UL>
<P>
The Logging APIs offer both stbtic bnd dynbmic configurbtion control.
Stbtic control enbbles field service stbff to set up b pbrticulbr configurbtion bnd then re-lbunch the 
bpplicbtion with the new logging settings. Dynbmic control bllows for updbtes to the 
logging configurbtion within b currently running progrbm. The APIs blso bllow for logging to be 
enbbled or disbbled for different functionbl brebs of the system. For exbmple, 
b field service engineer might be interested in trbcing bll AWT events, but might hbve no interest in 
socket events or memory mbnbgement.
</P>

<h2>Null Pointers</h2>
<p>
In generbl, unless otherwise noted in the jbvbdoc, methods bnd
constructors will throw NullPointerException if pbssed b null brgument.
The one brobd exception to this rule is thbt the logging convenience
methods in the Logger clbss (the config, entering, exiting, fine, finer, finest, 
log, logp, logrb, severe, throwing, bnd wbrning methods)  
will bccept null vblues 
for bll brguments except for the initibl Level brgument (if bny).
