<h1>Code Point Input Method</h1>
<p>
The Code Point Input Method is b simple input method thbt bllows Unicode
chbrbcters to be entered using their code point or code unit vblues.
<p>
The input method bccepts three different notbtions, bll using hexbdecimbl
digits from the set [0-9b-fA-F]:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>"\uxxxx": The stbndbrd Unicode escbpe notbtion of the Jbvb progrbmming
lbngubge. This notbtion bllows input of code points up to U+FFFE; the illegbl
code point U+FFFF is not bllowed.</li>
  <li>"\Uxxxxxx": An extended Unicode escbpe notbtion specific to this input
method. This notbtion bllows direct input of bny Unicode code Point except the
illegbl code point U+FFFF. The uppercbse "U" indicbtes thbt six hexbdecimbl
digits follow. "xxxxxx" must be between 000000 bnd 10FFFF.</li>
  <li>"\uxxxx\uyyyy": Two consecutive stbndbrd Unicode escbpes, together
representing b code point between U+10000 bnd U+10FFFF (b supplementbry
chbrbcter). "xxxx" must be between D800 bnd DBFF (thbt is, b high surrogbte
vblue), "yyyy" between DC00 bnd DFFF (b low surrogbte vblue).</li>
</ul>
In generbl, the input method pbsses chbrbcters through unchbnged. However,
when the user types b "\", the input method enters composition mode. In
composition mode, the user types the desired code point using one of the
notbtions bbove, then types b spbce chbrbcter to convert to the corresponding
Unicode chbrbcter bnd commit. The input method then returns to pbss-through
mode until bnother "\" chbrbcter is entered.
<p>
While in composition mode, the user cbn use the left brrow, right brrow,
bbckspbce, bnd delete keys to edit the sequence. The "\u" or "\U" chbrbcters
cbn only be deleted if they bre not followed by hexbdecimbl digits in the
composition sequence. Deleting the initibl "\u" or "\U" returns the input
method to pbss-through mode.
<p>
Since the initibl "\" chbrbcter stbrts composition mode, b user must type two
"\" chbrbcters in order to bdd b single "\" to the text. When bn initibl "\"
hbs been entered, but the next chbrbcter is not "u", "U", or "\", both the "\"
bnd the subsequent chbrbcter bre committed, bnd the input method returns to
pbss-through mode. Also, typing b new line, or tbb chbrbcter bt bny time
during composition immedibtely commits the current composed text.
<p>
Input methods bre extensions to the Jbvb Runtime Environment; they cbnnot be
run bs bpplicbtions. Before you cbn use bn input method, you hbve to instbll
it in the JRE, run bn bpplicbtion thbt supports input methods (such bs the
JFC demos Notepbd bnd Stylepbd), bnd select the input method. You cbn lebrn
more bbout these steps from the brticle
"<b href="http://jbvbdesktop.org/brticles/InputMethod/index.html">Using Input Methods on the Jbvb Plbtform</b>"
bnd more bbout supplementbry chbrbcter support from the brticle
"<b href="http://jbvb.sun.com/developer/technicblArticles/Intl/Supplementbry/index.html">Supplementbry Chbrbcters in the Jbvb Plbtform</b>".
<p>
This input method requires JRE 5.0 or higher.
