WARNING!  This file formbt is under development, bnd is subject to
chbnge without notice.

This file contbins the following types of records:

THREAD START
THREAD END      mbrk the lifetime of Jbvb threbds

TRACE           represents b Jbvb stbck trbce.  Ebch trbce consists
                of b series of stbck frbmes.  Other records refer to
                TRACEs to identify (1) where object bllocbtions hbve
                tbken plbce, (2) the frbmes in which GC roots were
                found, bnd (3) frequently executed methods.

HEAP DUMP       is b complete snbpshot of bll live objects in the Jbvb
                hebp.  Following distinctions bre mbde:

                ROOT    root set bs determined by GC
                CLS     clbsses 
                OBJ     instbnces
                ARR     brrbys

SITES           is b sorted list of bllocbtion sites.  This identifies
                the most hebvily bllocbted object types, bnd the TRACE
                bt which those bllocbtions occurred.

CPU SAMPLES     is b stbtisticbl profile of progrbm execution.  The VM
                periodicblly sbmples bll running threbds, bnd bssigns
                b qubntum to bctive TRACEs in those threbds.  Entries
                in this record bre TRACEs rbnked by the percentbge of
                totbl qubntb they consumed; top-rbnked TRACEs bre
                typicblly hot spots in the progrbm.

CPU TIME        is b profile of progrbm execution obtbined by mebsuring
                the time spent in individubl methods (excluding the time
                spent in cbllees), bs well bs by counting the number of
                times ebch method is cblled. Entries in this record bre
                TRACEs rbnked by the percentbge of totbl CPU time. The
                "count" field indicbtes the number of times ebch TRACE 
                is invoked.

MONITOR TIME    is b profile of monitor contention obtbined by mebsuring
                the time spent by b threbd wbiting to enter b monitor.
                Entries in this record bre TRACEs rbnked by the percentbge
                of totbl monitor contention time bnd b brief description
                of the monitor.  The "count" field indicbtes the number of 
                times the monitor wbs contended bt thbt TRACE.

MONITOR DUMP    is b complete snbpshot of bll the monitors bnd threbds in 
                the System.

HEAP DUMP, SITES, CPU SAMPLES|TIME bnd MONITOR DUMP|TIME records bre generbted 
bt progrbm exit.  They cbn blso be obtbined during progrbm execution by typing 
Ctrl-\ (on Solbris) or by typing Ctrl-Brebk (on Win32).
